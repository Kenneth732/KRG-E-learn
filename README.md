1. The `try` block is used to wrap the code that may throw an error. If an error occurs within the `try` block, the code execution will jump to the `catch` block.

2. `await` is used to wait for the promise returned by the `fetch()` function to resolve. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.

3. Inside the `try` block, there are three asynchronous fetch requests to the GitHub API to retrieve user data, repositories, and followers.

4. Each fetch request is awaited, meaning the code will pause execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.

5. The response from each fetch request is obtained by calling `.json()` on the response object. This converts the response body into a JavaScript object.

6. The obtained data is then set in the component state using the respective `setUserData`, `setRepositories`, and `setFollowers` functions.

7. If an error occurs during any of the fetch requests, the code execution will jump to the `catch` block.

8. In the `catch` block, the error is logged to the console using `console.error()`. This allows you to see the specific error message and handle it appropriately.

In summary, this code uses `async/await` to perform asynchronous fetch requests to the GitHub API. It waits for each request to complete and then sets the retrieved data in the component state. If any error occurs, it is caught and logged to the console.
